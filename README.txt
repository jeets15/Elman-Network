Evaluated the Elman Networkâ€™s ability to learn world-centred navigation tasks from self-centred experiences in a grid-world environment. The network achieved 83% accuracy on single-perspective tasks but dropped to 57% with multi-perspective data, revealing limitations in handling diverse viewpoints.
Improved multi-perspective performance by 4% through hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation.
Delivered findings through reports and presentations, highlighting potential for advanced models like LSTMs.
